# Validation best practices
best_practices:
  - "Validate data on both client and server side"
  - "Provide clear, actionable error messages"
  - "Group related validation errors together"
  - "Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks"
  - "Use consistent date/time formats throughout the API"
  - "Validate healthcare identifiers (NPI, DEA, etc.) using checksums where applicable"
  - "Consider timezone implications for appointment scheduling"
  - "Implement field-level validation before submission"
