# Healthie MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI-powered tools for Healthie GraphQL API development. Designed specifically for building healthcare applications with intelligent schema analysis, query optimization, and workflow guidance.

## What It Does

This MCP server acts as an advanced development assistant that understands healthcare workflows and provides:

- **Smart Schema Analysis**: Intelligent GraphQL schema search and type introspection
- **Healthcare Workflow Detection**: Identifies common patterns for patient management, appointments, clinical data, and billing
- **Query Optimization**: Performance analysis and optimization recommendations
- **Code Generation**: Multi-language examples and pre-built query templates
- **Error Resolution**: Intelligent error decoding with healthcare-specific solutions
- **Validation Tools**: Healthcare-compliant input validation and field usage guidance

## Quick Start

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for immediate setup and usage.

## Development Setup

See [DEV_SETUP.md](DEV_SETUP.md) for comprehensive development environment configuration.
