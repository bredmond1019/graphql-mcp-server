# Getting Started with Healthie MCP Server

This guide will help you understand what the Healthie MCP server is, why you'd use it, and how to get started with your first queries.

## ü§î What is this?

The Healthie MCP Server is an AI-powered development assistant that helps you work with Healthie's GraphQL API more effectively. Instead of manually browsing through documentation or guessing query structures, you can ask the AI directly:

- "Show me how to create a patient"
- "What fields are available for appointments?"
- "Help me build a query for clinical notes"
- "How do I validate a medical record number?"

## üéØ Why would I use this?

### Before (Traditional Development)
```bash
# Manual process:
1. Open GraphQL schema documentation
2. Search through hundreds of types manually
3. Figure out field relationships
4. Write queries from scratch
5. Debug validation errors
6. Repeat for each new feature
```

### After (With MCP Server)
```bash
# AI-assisted process:
1. Ask: "How do I create a patient?"
2. Get pre-built query templates
3. See example variables and validation rules
4. Get healthcare-specific guidance
5. Build features faster with less errors
```

## üè• Perfect for Healthcare Apps

This server is specifically designed for healthcare applications using Healthie:

- **Patient Management Systems** - Registration, demographics, medical history
- **Appointment Scheduling** - Booking, availability, reminders
- **Clinical Documentation** - Notes, assessments, care plans
- **Billing & Insurance** - Claims, payments, authorizations
- **Provider Portals** - Credentials, schedules, patient management

## üöÄ Your First 5 Minutes

### 1. Install and Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
# Clone and setup
cd python-mcp-server
uv sync

# Set your API endpoint
export HEALTHIE_API_URL="https://staging-api.gethealthie.com/graphql"
```

### 2. Start the Server (30 seconds)
```bash
# Development mode with inspector
uv run mcp dev src/healthie_mcp/server.py:mcp

# Or install in Claude Desktop
uv run mcp install src/healthie_mcp/server.py:mcp --name "Healthie Assistant"
```

### 3. Try Your First Queries (2.5 minutes)

**Find patient-related fields:**
```
search_schema query="patient" type_filter="type"
```

**Get pre-built query templates:**
```
query_templates workflow="patient_management"
```

**Understand a specific type:**
```
introspect_type type_name="Patient"
```

**Get code examples:**
```
code_examples category="patient_management" language="javascript"
```

## üîç Real-World Examples

### Building a Patient Registration Form

**Ask the MCP server:**
```
query_templates workflow="patient_management"
```

**Get response with ready-to-use queries:**
```graphql
mutation CreatePatient($input: CreatePatientInput!) {
  createPatient(input: $input) {
    patient {
      id
      email
      firstName
      lastName
      dateOfBirth
      phoneNumber
    }
    errors
  }
}
```

**Plus validation guidance:**
```json
{
  "variables": {
    "input": {
      "email": "patient@example.com",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
      "phoneNumber": "+1234567890"
    }
  },
  "validation_notes": [
    "Email must be unique across the system",
    "Phone number should include country code",
    "Date of birth must be in YYYY-MM-DD format"
  ]
}
```

### Finding Available Appointment Slots

**Ask for appointment workflows:**
```
workflow_sequences category="appointments"
```

**Get step-by-step guidance:**
```yaml
name: "Book Patient Appointment"
steps:
  1. "Query provider availability"
  2. "Check patient eligibility" 
  3. "Create appointment"
  4. "Send confirmation"
queries:
  - name: "Get Available Slots"
    query: |
      query GetAvailability($providerId: ID!, $date: String!) {
        availabilitySlots(providerId: $providerId, date: $date) {
          startTime
          endTime
          available
        }
      }
```

### Validating Healthcare Data

**Check medical identifier formats:**
```
input_validation field_type="medical_identifiers"
```

**Get validation rules:**
```json
{
  "npi": {
    "pattern": "^\\d{10}$",
    "description": "National Provider Identifier - 10 digits",
    "example": "1234567890"
  },
  "medical_record_number": {
    "pattern": "^[A-Z]{2}\\d{6}$", 
    "description": "Format: 2 letters + 6 digits",
    "example": "MR123456"
  }
}
```

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Start with templates** - Use `query_templates` to get working queries quickly
- **Validate early** - Use `input_validation` to catch errors before API calls
- **Search efficiently** - Use type filters in `search_schema` to narrow results
- **Learn patterns** - Use `healthcare_patterns` to understand FHIR mappings
- **Debug systematically** - Use `error_decoder` when things go wrong
