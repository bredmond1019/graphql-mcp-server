## Common Performance Issues in Healthcare Queries

1. **Patient List Queries**
   - Issue: Fetching all patients without pagination
   - Solution: Implement cursor-based pagination

2. **Medical History Queries**
   - Issue: Loading complete history for multiple patients
   - Solution: Load on-demand with date ranges

3. **Provider Schedule Queries**
   - Issue: Fetching all appointments for all providers
   - Solution: Filter by date range and specific providers

4. **Document/Attachment Queries**
   - Issue: Loading file content in list queries
   - Solution: Return metadata only, load content separately

5. **Analytics Queries**
   - Issue: Real-time computation of complex metrics
   - Solution: Pre-compute and cache analytics data

## Best Practices

1. **Always paginate collections**: Use `first`, `after`, `before`, `last` parameters
2. **Limit nesting depth**: Keep queries under 5 levels deep
3. **Use field selection**: Only request fields you need
4. **Implement DataLoader**: Batch and cache database queries
5. **Cache expensive operations**: Use appropriate TTL for different data types
6. **Monitor query performance**: Track slow queries in production
7. **Test with realistic data**: Ensure queries scale with production data volumes
