# Phase 3 Tools Test Summary

This document summarizes the testing results for the 9 tools in the `src/healthie_mcp/tools/todo/` directory.

## Overview

All 9 tools had import issues that were fixed by changing relative imports from `..` to `...` to match the todo subdirectory structure. After fixing imports, we tested the core logic of each tool.

## Import Fix Applied

Changed all imports in todo tools from:
```python
from ..base import BaseTool
from ..models.xxx import YYY
```

To:
```python
from ...base import BaseTool
from ...models.xxx import YYY
```

## Test Approach

Due to circular import issues with the MCP framework, we tested the tools using:

1. **Direct logic testing**: Tested core algorithms and patterns without MCP dependencies
2. **Minimal validation**: Verified that the essential functionality works
3. **Import verification**: Confirmed all imports are correctly structured

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing of remaining 5 tools
2. Create comprehensive test cases for each tool
3. Move tested and verified tools from `todo/` to main `tools/` directory
4. Update server.py to register the new tools
5. Create detailed documentation for each tool
6. Update README.md to include all 17 tools (8 existing + 9 new)

## Summary

- **Import Issues**: Fixed in all 9 tools ✅
- **Logic Tested**: 4/9 tools verified ✅
- **Ready for Integration**: 4 tools ready to be moved to production
- **Remaining Work**: Test 5 more tools, then integrate all 9 into the MCP server
