# Validation Rules and Best Practices
validation_rules:
  endpoint_requirements:
    - "Endpoint must use HTTPS in production environments"
    - "Endpoint should return 2xx status codes for successful webhook receipt"

  security_requirements:
    - "Always verify webhook signatures using HMAC-SHA256"
    - "Validate timestamp to prevent replay attacks"
    - "Log all webhook receipts for audit purposes"
    - "Implement proper error handling and retry logic"
