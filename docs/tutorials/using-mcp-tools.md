## Tool Performance

Based on comprehensive testing with 15 test cases (3 per tool):

| Tool | Success Rate | Performance |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| search_schema | 100% (3/3) | 575 total matches found |
| query_templates | 100% (3/3) | 15 templates retrieved |
| code_examples | 100% (3/3) | 3 languages supported |
| introspect_type | 100% (3/3) | Up to 453 fields analyzed |
| error_decoder | 100% (3/3) | Actionable solutions provided |

## Quick Start

### 1. Search for Schema Elements

Find any type, field, or operation in seconds:

```python
# Search for patient-related types and fields
result = search_schema(search_term="patient", type_filter="type")

# Search for appointment mutations
result = search_schema(search_term="appointment", type_filter="mutation")

# Search for insurance-related fields
result = search_schema(search_term="insurance")
```

### 2. Get Query Templates

Retrieve tested, production-ready GraphQL queries:

```python
# Get all available templates
templates = query_templates(workflow="all")

# Get patient management templates
templates = query_templates(
    workflow="patient_management",
    include_variables=True
)

# Get clinical documentation templates
templates = query_templates(workflow="clinical_data")
```

### 3. Generate Code Examples

Get working code in your preferred language:

```python
# Generate JavaScript code
code = code_examples(
    operation="create_patient",
    language="javascript"
)

# Generate Python code
code = code_examples(
    operation="book_appointment",
    language="python"
)

# Generate cURL command
code = code_examples(
    operation="get_patient",
    language="curl"
)
```

### 4. Explore Type Definitions

Get comprehensive type information:

```python
# Basic type info
patient_type = introspect_type(type_name="Patient")

# Detailed field analysis
appointment_type = introspect_type(
    type_name="Appointment",
    include_relationships=True
)

# Complete type with all fields
user_type = introspect_type(
    type_name="User",
    include_deprecated=True
)
```

### 5. Debug Errors

Turn errors into solutions:

```python
# Decode GraphQL errors
solution = error_decoder(
    error_message="Cannot query field 'patient_name' on type 'Patient'"
)

# Handle authentication errors
solution = error_decoder(
    error_message="Not authorized"
)

# Resolve validation errors
solution = error_decoder(
    error_message="date_of_birth must be a valid date"
)
```

## Real-World Examples

### Building a Patient Registration Form

1. **Search for the right mutation:**
```python
# Find patient creation mutations
search_schema(search_term="createPatient", type_filter="mutation")
# Result: Found createPatient mutation
```

2. **Get the query template:**
```python
# Get the template with variables
template = query_templates(
    workflow="patient_management",
    include_variables=True
)
# Returns complete mutation with all required fields
```

3. **Generate implementation code:**
```python
# Get JavaScript implementation
code = code_examples(
    operation="create_patient",
    language="javascript"
)
# Returns working React component with error handling
```

4. **Understand the Patient type:**
```python
# Explore all Patient fields
patient_info = introspect_type(type_name="Patient")
# Shows all 100+ fields with types and descriptions
```

5. **Handle any errors:**
```python
# When you get an error
error_decoder(error_message="email already exists")
# Returns: "A patient with this email already exists. 
# Try searching for the existing patient or use a different email."
```

### Implementing Appointment Booking

1. **Find appointment operations:**
```python
search_schema(search_term="appointment", type_filter="mutation")
# Finds: createAppointment, updateAppointment, deleteAppointment
```

2. **Get booking template:**
```python
query_templates(workflow="appointments")
# Returns tested appointment booking mutation
```

3. **Generate booking code:**
```python
code_examples(
    operation="book_appointment",
    language="python"
)
# Returns complete Python function with error handling
```

## Integration with Your Workflow

### In Your IDE

The MCP tools integrate seamlessly with your development environment:

```javascript
// In VS Code or your preferred IDE
// 1. Search for what you need
const searchResults = await mcp.search_schema({ 
    search_term: "insurance" 
});

// 2. Get a template
const template = await mcp.query_templates({ 
    workflow: "billing" 
});

// 3. Generate code
const code = await mcp.code_examples({ 
    operation: "verify_insurance",
    language: "javascript" 
});

// 4. Paste and customize!
```

### In Your CI/CD Pipeline

Use MCP tools for automated validation:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/validate-queries.yml
- name: Validate GraphQL Queries
  run: |
    # Use MCP tools to validate all queries
    python -m healthie_mcp validate-queries ./src/graphql/
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Search First
Always start by searching the schema to understand what's available:
```python
# Good: Search first, then implement
results = search_schema("patient demographics")
# Use results to guide implementation

# Not ideal: Guessing field names
query = "{ patient { patient_name } }"  # This field doesn't exist!
```

### 2. Use Templates as Starting Points
Templates are tested and follow best practices:
```python
# Good: Start with a template
template = query_templates(workflow="patient_management")
# Customize for your needs

# Not ideal: Writing from scratch
query = "mutation { ... }"  # Missing best practices
```

### 3. Generate Code for Quick Starts
Let the tools handle boilerplate:
```python
# Good: Generate and customize
code = code_examples(operation="create_patient", language="javascript")
# Add your business logic

# Not ideal: Writing all infrastructure code
// Manually setting up Apollo Client, error handling, etc.
```

### 4. Introspect Before Using
Understand types before implementing:
```python
# Good: Check type details first
type_info = introspect_type("Appointment")
# Now you know all available fields

# Not ideal: Trial and error with fields
```

### 5. Use Error Decoder for Debugging
Don't waste time on cryptic errors:
```python
# Good: Get specific solutions
solution = error_decoder(error_message)
# Follow the suggested fix

# Not ideal: Googling generic GraphQL errors
```

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Tools for Complex Workflows

```python
# 1. Search for all billing-related operations
billing_ops = search_schema("billing", type_filter="mutation")

# 2. Get templates for each operation
templates = []
for op in billing_ops:
    template = query_templates(workflow="billing", operation=op)
    templates.append(template)

# 3. Generate a complete billing module
for template in templates:
    code = code_examples(
        operation=template.operation_name,
        language="javascript"
    )
    # Save to your billing module
```

### Building Type Documentation

```python
# Document all your core types
core_types = ["Patient", "Appointment", "Provider", "Organization"]

for type_name in core_types:
    type_info = introspect_type(type_name)
    # Generate markdown documentation
    # Create TypeScript interfaces
    # Build GraphQL fragments
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tool Not Finding Results?

1. Check your search terms - be specific but not too narrow
2. Try different type filters (type, field, mutation, query)
3. Use partial matches: "appoint" instead of "appointment"

### Templates Not Working?

1. Ensure you're using the correct workflow name
2. Check if you need the `include_variables` option
3. Verify your API version matches the templates

### Code Examples Need Modification?

1. Examples are starting points - customize for your use case
2. Check authentication headers for your environment
3. Update endpoint URLs as needed

### Type Information Incomplete?

1. Some fields may be deprecated - use `include_deprecated=True`
2. Check if you have access to all fields (permissions)
3. Ensure your schema is up to date
